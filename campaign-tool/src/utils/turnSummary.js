/**
 * Turn Dispatch: the end-of-turn summary.
 *
 * Takes the battle records belonging to a single turn and writes them up as a
 * field dispatch. Who marched, who bled, what changed hands, and how the war
 * looks as the armies step off into the next month. TurnSummary.jsx renders the
 * structured result; `formatTurnSummaryText` flattens it to Discord text.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and deterministic. Word choice varies from battle to
 * battle, but every choice is seeded off stable ids, so the dispatch you pasted
 * into Discord last week still matches the one on screen today.
