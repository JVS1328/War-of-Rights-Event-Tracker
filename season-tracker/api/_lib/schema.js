/**
 * The database, as tables.
 *
 * Five of them, and the shape follows how the site reads: an event row is what
 * the directory lists, a scoreboard row is one round, and the summary columns
 * beside its payload are there so a list view never has to load a killfeed.
 * Everything else an event owns — pins, renames, the tracker's own state — is
 * a single JSON document keyed by the event, because that is exactly how the
 * screens hold them and nothing queries inside them.
 *
 * The DDL is idempotent and runs once per cold start, so a fresh Neon database
 * needs no migration step: point WOR_DATABASE_URL at it and the first request
 * builds what it needs.
 */
/**
 * One statement, because it is nine round trips otherwise.
 *
 * The schema is created on the first request after a cold start rather than by
 * a migration step, so a fresh Neon database needs nothing but its URL. Sending
 * each CREATE separately meant the first visitor after an idle period waited
 * for nine round trips before anything was read; a DO block is one.
 *
 * Everything here is idempotent, so it is safe to run against a database that
 * already has it all.
