# How the Campaign Works

Welcome to the War of Rights Campaign! This document explains everything you need to know about how battles are decided, turn order, and the strategic mechanics that make each decision matter.

---

## The Basics

**Each turn represents ~2 months** of the Civil War campaign. Both sides (USA and CSA) make strategic decisions that determine where battles are fought.

**One Decision Per Turn:** Each team gets ONE action per turn:
- **ATTACK** an enemy or neutral territory
- **DEFEND** a territory you control

**Adjacency Matters:** You can only attack or defend territories that are **connected to enemy-controlled regions**. You can't defend a territory miles behind the front line - the battle must be happening at the border.

---

## Turn Order

### First Turn
Decided by **coin flip**. Winner chooses whether to go first or second.

### Subsequent Turns
Turn order is determined by the previous turn's results:

| Previous Turn Result | Next Turn's First Move |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| CSA won **both** rounds | CSA goes first |
| USA won **both** rounds | USA goes first |
| Split 1-1 | Whoever went **second** last turn now goes **first** |

This creates a dynamic where sweeping victories grant initiative, but close fights keep things competitive.

## How Battles Work

### Step 1: Map Selection (Pick/Ban System)

When a territory is contested, 5 maps are randomly selected from that territory's available maps.

**Ban Order:**
1. **Defender** bans a map
2. **Attacker** bans a map
3. **Defender** bans a map
4. **Attacker** bans a map
5. **Remaining map is played**

*Note: Maps go on cooldown for 2 turns after being played to encourage variety.*

### Step 2: Roll for Battle Conditions

Before the battle begins, roll for **weather** and **time of day** using d10 dice.

**Weather (d10):**
| Roll | Condition | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1-5 | Clear Skies | Sunny days and moonlit nights |
| 6-9 | Tempered Rainstorm | Moderate rain, playable conditions |
| 10 | Inclement Weather | Max rain - mud, blood, and 20 frames a second |

**Time of Day (d10):**
| Roll | Condition | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1-3 | Dawn | Early morning light |
| 4-7 | Standard | Default map time |
| 8-9 | Dusk | Evening twilight |
| 10 | Pitch Black Night | Night battle |

### Step 3: Fight the Battle

Play the War of Rights match! Record casualties for both sides.

### Step 4: Record Results

The winner captures (or holds) the territory. Both sides pay Supply Points (SP) based on:
- Territory value (higher VP = higher stakes)
- Casualties taken (more blood = more SP lost)

---

## Supply Points (SP) System

SP represents your army's ability to wage war. **Run out of SP and you lose the campaign.**

### How SP Works

**SP Generation:** Each turn, you gain SP equal to the total VP of territories you control (if they're connected to your supply lines).

**SP Costs in Battle:**

| Action | Base SP Cost |
|--------|-------------|
| Attacking Neutral Territory | 50 SP |
| Attacking Enemy Territory | 75 SP |
| Defending Your Territory | 25 SP |
| Defending Neutral Territory | 50 SP |

*These costs are multiplied by territory VP value and scaled by your casualty ratio.*

**Example:** If you attack a 3 VP enemy territory and take 60% of the casualties:
- Base: 75 SP × 3 (VP) × 0.6 (casualties) = **135 SP lost**

### Pyrrhic Victories

Even if you WIN, taking heavy casualties means heavy SP losses. Fight smart - a costly victory can cripple your campaign.

---

## Supply Lines

Territories must be **connected to friendly territories** to function properly.

**Supplied Territory:**
- Generates SP each turn
- Normal defense costs

**Encircled Territory (no adjacent friendly territories):**
- Generates 0 SP
- **2x defense cost** (isolated troops are expensive to support)

Cut off enemy territories to drain their resources!

---

## Special Abilities

Each side has a unique ability with a cooldown:

### USA: Special Orders 191
*"Finding Lee's battle plans"*
- When USA **attacks and wins**, the CSA defender loses **3x their normal SP**
- Devastating when used on high-value territories

### CSA: Valley Supply Lines
*"Efficient use of the Shenandoah Valley"*
- When CSA **attacks**, they pay only **50% of normal SP cost**
- Great for aggressive campaigns

*Abilities have a 2-turn cooldown after use.*

---

## Victory Conditions

The campaign ends when:

1. **SP Depletion** - If either side hits 0 SP, they immediately lose
2. **Total Conquest** - Control ALL territories for instant victory
3. **Campaign End (December 1865)** - Side with most VP wins

---

## Quick Reference

| Mechanic | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| Turn Length | ~2 months |
| Actions per Turn | 1 (Attack OR Defend) |
| Map Selection | Pick/ban (5 maps, 4 bans) |
| Weather/Time | d10 rolls before battle |
| SP Generation | VP of supplied territories |
| Encirclement | 2x defense cost, 0 SP generation |
| Victory | SP depletion, total conquest, or most VP at end |

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Manage SP carefully** - Aggressive campaigns can deplete your pool quickly
2. **Target high-value territories** - More VP means more SP generation
3. **Watch your casualties** - Even victories cost SP based on losses
4. **Use abilities strategically** - Save them for critical battles
5. **Cut supply lines** - Encircle enemy territories to drain their resources

Good luck, and may the best army win!
